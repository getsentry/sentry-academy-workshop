# Enrollment Functionality Implementation

This document describes the enrollment functionality that has been implemented for the Sentry Academy application.

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. Frontend Enrollment UI (CourseDetailPage)

**Location**: `apps/frontend/src/pages/CourseDetailPage.tsx`

**Features**:
- **Dynamic Enrollment Button**: Shows different states based on user authentication and enrollment status:
  - 🔐 "Login to Enroll" (unauthenticated users)
  - 📚 "Enroll Now" (authenticated, not enrolled)
  - ▶️ "Continue Learning" + 🗑️ "Unenroll" (enrolled users)
- **Visual Enrollment Status**: Green "Enrolled" badge when user is enrolled
- **Progress Bar**: Shows course completion progress for enrolled users
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during enrollment/unenrollment

### 2. Custom React Hook

**Location**: `apps/frontend/src/hooks/useEnrollment.ts`

**Features**:
- Reusable enrollment logic across components
- Automatic enrollment status checking
- Clean API for enroll/unenroll actions
- Loading state management
- Error handling

### 3. Backend API (Already Existed)

**Location**: `apps/server/src/modules/enrollments/routes.ts`

**Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/enrollments` - Create enrollment
- `GET /api/enrollments/user/:userId` - Get user enrollments
- `GET /api/enrollments/:id` - Get enrollment details
- `PUT /api/enrollments/:id` - Update enrollment
- `DELETE /api/enrollments/:id` - Delete enrollment (unenroll)

### 4. Database Schema (Already Existed)

**Location**: `apps/server/db/schema.ts`

**Tables**:
- `enrollments` - Core enrollment records
- `lessonProgress` - Track lesson completion
- `users` - User information
- `courses` - Course data

## 🔧 Database Setup

This application uses **PostgreSQL** with Drizzle ORM. Make sure you have:

1. **PostgreSQL database** running
2. **DATABASE_URL** environment variable set in `apps/server/.env`
3. **Database migrations** run: `cd apps/server && npm run db:migrate`
4. **Sample data** seeded: `cd apps/server && npm run db:seed`

## 🚀 Testing the Functionality

1. **Start the development server**: `pnpm dev`
2. **Navigate to a course**: Go to any course detail page
3. **Test enrollment flow**:
   - If not logged in → Click "Login to Enroll"
   - If logged in → Click "Enroll Now"
   - If enrolled → See "Continue Learning" and "Unenroll" buttons
4. **Check My Courses page**: See enrolled courses with progress bars
5. **Test unenrollment**: Click "Unenroll" or "Remove" on My Courses page

## 💡 Key Implementation Details

### Authentication Integration
- Uses existing `useAuth` hook from AuthContext
- Redirects to `/login` for unauthenticated users
- Works with the mock authentication system

### Error Handling
- Network errors are caught and displayed to users
- Database constraints prevent duplicate enrollments
- Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental actions

### State Management
- Local state for UI interactions
- API calls for data persistence
- Optimistic updates for better UX

### Database Updates
- Enrollment count automatically updated on courses
- Progress tracking prepared for future lesson completion
- Proper foreign key relationships maintained

## 🎯 User Flow

```
Course Browse → Course Detail → Enroll → My Courses → Progress Tracking
                     ↓                            ↓
               Enrollment Status            Unenroll Option
```

## ⚠️ Notes

- The enrollment functionality uses the existing PostgreSQL database setup
- Mock authentication system is used (not production-ready)
- The backend API was already fully implemented
- Progress tracking is prepared but lesson completion is not yet implemented

## 🔜 Potential Future Enhancements

- Email notifications for enrollment confirmations
- Enrollment limits and waitlists
- Bulk enrollment operations
- Advanced progress analytics
- Certificate generation upon completion
